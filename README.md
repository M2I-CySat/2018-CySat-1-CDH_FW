CySat-1
C&DH Firmware
=====

Firmware running on the Command and Data Handling board for CySat-1.  This firmware operates all major functions of the satellite.

## Branch Structure
### Master
The master branch is kept as a working "Tech Demo" of Core.
Once a major improvement is finalized in Core, it can be merged into
Master.

This may be replaced with tags once CySat reaches a stable condition.

### Core
The core branch is payload-independent. It is responsible for the implementation
of the CySat platform APIs as specified in the Doxygen documentation.

Core is regularly merged into both payload-specific branches and Master
when major features are implemented.

### Payload-specific branches.
Payload-specific branches contain both the payload handling code and the 
platform code that is adapted to the specific payload. A payload-specific
branch should never be merged into Main or Core.

## Documentation
The CySat platform API is documented with Doxygen. Documentation can be
generated by running the doxygen command. Generated documentation is not
tracked with Git. All documentation comes from header files, not from
any source code files, so it is possible to read through header files
to find the necessary information.

Generated documentation is output in HTML to the doc/html directory.
